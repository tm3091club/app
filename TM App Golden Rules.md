Golden Rules (do not break these)

Stack is locked: Frontend = React (TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind). Backend = Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Functions). No migrations to other stacks.

Firestore-first: Persist all app state in Cloud Firestore. Do not introduce a second database.

Schema stability: Never rename or delete existing collections/fields without a backward-compatible migration plan outlined in writing.

Security & tenancy: All reads/writes must be scoped to the user’s club (tenant) using ownerId/clubId. No cross-club reads.

Permissions: Admins can assign any role. Members can only self-assign to unassigned roles they’re qualified for; they can unassign themselves with guardrails.

Scheduling canon: Use the canonical role lists and officer fallback logic; never reorder or relabel roles without explicit instruction.

UX parity: Features must work on mobile Safari (PWA) and desktop equally; verify print/PDF output remains one page for weekly agenda.

Timezone & dates: Use IANA timezones; treat month indexes as 0-based; meeting dates derive from club meeting day.

Sharing: Public share links are read-only live views; any change in the app reflects instantly on the shared page.

Versioning: Keep the automated date+push counter version display in the footer as shipped.

Before you change anything

Confirm change is tenant-safe, schema-safe, and permission-safe.

If schema is touched, write a migration plan with: staged rollout, dual-write/read, backfill, cleanup.

Keep PWA behavior (installable, full-screen) intact.

Keep printing styles and “Export as PDF/Sheets (TSV)” outputs intact.

If the user is new

On first club creation, route to Manage Members (not Schedule).

Provide tooltips to guide “Add New Member” and “Set Availability”.

📘 Toastmasters Monthly Scheduler — Master Spec & Implementation Manual
0) Purpose & Audience

This document is the source of truth for how the Toastmasters app should behave. It’s written for engineers and AI copilots who will read/modify code. Its goal is consistency and safety: preserve logic, data model, and UX while allowing incremental improvements.

1) Tech Stack & Core Modules

Frontend: React 19 + TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite. PWA enabled (manifest, apple touch icon, theme color). Print styles for agendas/schedules are included.

Backend: Firebase

Auth (Email/Password only)

Firestore (all persistent data)

Extensions/Functions: Outbound email via Firebase extension (club invitations, notifications)

PDF/Sheets: jsPDF + autotable for PDF; TSV for Google Sheets export.

AI helpers: Optional “Generate Themes” via @google/genai; keep as an additive feature.

Versioning: Automatic date-and-push counter displayed in footer (e.g., 9.17.25-2). Do not remove.

2) Multitenancy Model & Identities

Tenant = Club. Each club is administered by a “club admin” (the initial user).

ownerId/clubId: Every entity references the owning club. Do not read/write outside the current ownerId/clubId.

Users & Members:

users are Firebase Auth accounts (admins or members).

members are the scheduling entities (can exist before the person signs up).

Linking happens when an invited person creates an account; their Firebase uid is recorded on the member.

Officer roles are assigned to admins, with President → VPE fallback if the President is unavailable for a meeting. Keep this logic stable. (Roles are defined in constants and types; see codebase.)

3) Firestore Data Model (current, keep stable)

Top-level collections (names must remain stable unless migrated safely):

invitations — pending invites sent via email. Status: pending/accepted/revoked.

mail — Firebase email extension write-in collection.

notifications — per-user notifications (role reminders, open roles, blackout, etc.).

publicSchedules / publicAgendas — read-only shared docs (live views).

users — application users (club admins and members) with per-club scoping.

Per club (via ownerId / club profile):

Organization (Club Profile) — stores:

name, district, clubNumber, ownerId (the creator’s uid), meetingDay (0–6), timezone (IANA), autoNotificationDay (1–28)

adminInfo (email, uid)

members (denormalized snapshot to speed UI; contains: id, name, email?, joinedDate, status, qualifications, uid?, role (Admin|Member), and officerRole?)

Members — canonical list used by the schedule:

id (deterministic string), name, status (Active|Possible|Unavailable|Archived), joinedDate, ownerId, uid?

Qualifications booleans: isToastmaster, isTableTopicsMaster, isGeneralEvaluator, isPastPresident

officerRole? (for President/VPE logic)

Availability — per member, keyed by ISO YYYY-MM-DD meeting date to Available|Possible|Unavailable.

Schedules — per month (id: YYYY-MM, year, month (0-indexed), isShared?, shareId?):

meetings[]: each with date (ISO), theme, assignments{ role: memberId|null }, isBlackout?

ownerId (club scope)

WeeklyAgendas — per week index within the month:

Items (~37 rows) with fields for time, program event, “key role”, person, description, color. Also contains theme, shareId, scheduleId, ownerId, next meeting preview, timestamps.

Note: A legacy LastJoinToken field exists; preserve for compatibility (do not delete silently). If deprecating, mark as optional and leave reads tolerant of its absence.

4) Roles & Scheduling Canon
Role Lists (source of truth)

All roles (order matters for UI and exports):
President, Pledge, Thought of the Day, Toastmaster, Grammarian, Timekeeper, Ah-Counter, Ballot Counter, Table Topics Master, Evaluator 1, Speaker 1, Evaluator 2, Speaker 2, Evaluator 3, Speaker 3, General Evaluator, Inspiration Award.

Major roles: President, Toastmaster, Table Topics Master, General Evaluator, Speaker 1–3, Inspiration Award.

Minor roles: Pledge, Thought of the Day, Grammarian, Timekeeper, Ah-Counter, Ballot Counter, Evaluators 1–3.
(These are encoded in Constants.ts and must not drift.)

Qualification checks

Toastmaster requires isToastmaster.

Table Topics Master requires isTableTopicsMaster.

General Evaluator requires isGeneralEvaluator.

Inspiration Award uses isPastPresident gate (as shipped).

Officer fallback

President of the club is placed as President by default. If unavailable that week, VPE fills President automatically. Otherwise unassigned and must be manually filled. (Keep this precise behavior.)

5) Permissions Matrix
Action	Admin	Member
Create/Delete monthly schedule	✅	❌
Generate AI Themes	✅	❌
Toggle Blackout	✅	❌
Edit meeting Theme	✅	❌
Assign roles for anyone	✅	❌
Self-assign to unassigned roles (if qualified)	—	✅
Unassign self (with speaker warning)	—	✅
Edit Weekly Agenda	✅ and the week’s Toastmaster	❌
Change availability	Can edit anyone	Only own (if linked)

Additional constraints:

On a change to a major role, remove the member from any other major role in the same meeting.

Members see themselves labeled subtly (e.g., “me”/blue highlight) and cannot assign others.

Blackout clears visible assignments (saved in hidden property for restore) and prevents edits; un-blackout restores.

6) Date/Time Rules

month stored as 0-indexed (Jan = 0). Display with toLocaleString based on club timezone when appropriate.

Meeting dates are all occurrences of the club’s meeting day in that month.

Many UI displays use toLocaleDateString(..., { timeZone:'UTC' }) to stabilize date-only output — keep that pattern to avoid off-by-one from local offsets.

Availability keys are ISO dates YYYY-MM-DD derived from the meeting date (split at 'T' as in the current code).

Utility references: getCurrentMonthInfo, getNextMonthInfo, getRelevantMonthsForAvailability, getNextScheduleMonth—respect their 0-indexing and rollover behavior.

7) Invitations & Linking

Admins can pre-create members without emails. Those members are fully assignable by admins.

“Link Account” flow:

Search for existing unlinked account by name/email; if not found, send invitation via Firebase email extension.

Invitation creates an invitations doc with token; when user signs up, we store their uid on the member.

Keep Pending to be Linked UI: resend invite, change email, remove invitation (which can also remove the member if appropriate).

Unlink remains available for edge cases—do not remove.

8) Notifications

Types include:

Schedule Published, Role Reminder (next meeting), Availability Request (for next month, on autoNotificationDay), Role Changed / Unassigned, Meeting Blackout, Speaker Unassigned (notify evaluator).
Use the provided notificationService functions and keep existing templates/behavior.

Unsubscribe route exists. Keep it functional and outside auth.

9) Sharing & Export

Share generates a live, read-only URL under tmapp.club/#/<clubNumber>/share/<token> for monthly schedules, and .../agenda/<token> for weekly agendas. Visitors see public pages with club name, schedule/agenda, and print/export buttons.

Export:

PDF: jsPDF autotable, landscape, fixed role column and up to four meeting columns, colored availability blocks. Keep one-page weekly agenda output.

Sheets (TSV): clipboard with tab-separated values, aligned to the visible schedule.

Print styles are tuned in styles/WeeklyAgenda.css and inline styles on public pages. Preserve red highlights for voting rows and blues for highlights when printing.

10) UX Flows

Auth:

Landing shows “Sign in” and “or Create a New Club”.

Signup (new club): club name, district (from Toastmasters list), club number (free text), meeting day, email, password (+ confirm).

Email confirmation: Required (add if missing); ensure no spam signups.

First-time club: After signup, redirect to Manage Members (not Schedule). Provide tooltips:

“Add New Member” (name, status, qualifications)

Set Join Date (affects speaker ordering for fairness: newest speak earlier)

Per-week Availability for current/next month.

Schedule Manager (default thereafter):

Dropdown to select existing month; special “Prepare Next/Previous” if absent.

Buttons: Generate Themes, Generate Schedule, Share, Export (PDF/TSV), Compare with Previous Month.

Table: sticky Role column; columns per meeting date; Blackout checkbox in header cell per meeting; theme row; role rows; bottom “Availability” lists (Available/Possible/Unavailable).

Weekly Agenda:

Select Week (auto-selects current week).

Edit Agenda (admins and that week’s Toastmaster): time, event, person, description, color, reordering.

Share → live link with “Print Agenda” and “Visit Main App”.

Export as one-page PDF.

Profile (Club Profile & My Profile):

Club Profile: change display fields, timezone, meeting day, auto notification day. Trigger Role Reminders and Availability Request.

Team Management: assign Officer roles; ensure “No Officer Role” disappears when all are filled; remove role via ❌.

Security actions: change email/password with reauth; send password reset to members.

Notifications bell: opens panel with unread/read, navigate to availability, fetch previous notifications.

11) Security & Rules-of-Engagement

Firestore reads/writes must be restricted by ownerId/clubId. Admins of a club can manage only their club. Members can only modify self data (availability; self-assign where allowed).

Never expose other clubs’ data in any list or query.

Public share docs contain only what’s needed for view; use a denormalized publicMembers[] with id and name only.

12) PWA, Accessibility, and Print

PWA: must be installable on iOS Safari; full-screen icon; dark mode respected.

Accessibility: semantic headings, focus rings, adequate contrast; all actionable icons have text or title.

Print: keep one-page agenda; preserve highlight colors (especially red voting rows); remove sticky behavior for printed role column (already handled in CSS).

13) Versioning & Build

Footer displays APP_VERSION from utils/version.ts.

The auto bump script (scripts/update-version.js) + git hooks set M.DD.YY-X.

NPM scripts:

npm run dev, npm run build, npm run preview

npm run version:update, npm run push (update version and push)

Do not remove or bypass the version display in app or on public pages.

14) Guardrails Against Logic Drift

Do NOT:

Change database vendor or add new persistent stores.

Rename existing fields/collections (e.g., members, schedules, weeklyAgendas, publicSchedules, publicAgendas, invitations) without a migration plan.

Alter canonical role order/names or officer fallback behavior.

Break the member-can-only-self-assign rule.

Change “blackout” semantics (must preserve/restore assignments).

If you must extend:

Add new optional fields (never remove old ones silently).

Add derived/denormalized documents (e.g., public*) only for display/performance, not as new sources of truth.

Produce a Migration Plan (staged, reversible, with telemetry).

15) Suggested Future Improvements (safe, staged)

Club identity hardening: Introduce explicit clubId (UUID) distinct from ownerId; keep ownerId for backwards compat. Dual-write for one release; backfill all docs; then read-prefer clubId.

Memberships table (multi-club members):

New collection memberships mapping { userUid, clubId, memberId, role }.

UI: add club switcher for users linked to multiple clubs.

Keep current behavior fully working; this is additive.

Indexes: Add composite indexes for schedule queries by ownerId + year + month, and for public docs by clubNumber + shareId.

Email confirmations: On club creation, require email verification and throttle new-club creation from the same IP/email.

Mentorship module: Add mentors collection { clubId, mentorId, menteeIds[], channels[], availability[] } and booking emails.

Deprecate LastJoinToken: Mark as legacy; add null-tolerant reads; remove usage over time after audit.

UTC consistency check: Audit all places dates are created/parsed; enforce a single utility to derive the dateKey and to format meeting headers with the club’s timezone for display and UTC for “date-only” operations.

All of the above must follow the migration discipline described earlier.

16) Test Plan (minimum)

Mobile Safari + Desktop Chromium/Firefox:

Auth → New Club → Redirect to Manage Members.

Add member, set qualifications, set availability current/next month.

Generate schedule (no crashes with empty historical data).

Self-assign as member (qualified, unassigned role).

Admin reassigns roles; major-role exclusivity enforced.

Blackout toggles & restores assignments; notification fires for blackout.

Share schedule & agenda: links open read-only, reflect live changes.

Export PDF (landscape; per-column widths; colors) & TSV (clipboard).

Weekly agenda remains one page in print.

Notifications: role reminder, availability request, role changed, speaker unassigned (evaluator notified).

Version footer visible on app and public pages.

17) Naming & Code Style

Types live in types.ts; roles in Constants.ts. Do not fork enums/role arrays elsewhere.

Month helpers in utils/monthUtils.ts drive UI text and date math—respect 0-index months and rollover logic.

Keep components accessible and Tailwind classes consistent with existing patterns; reuse shared UI (confirmation/tooltip/share modals).

18) Known Quirks (keep compatible)

Date-only keys rely on meetingDate.toISOString().split('T')[0]—continue using the same approach to match existing availability documents.

Public pages often format with timeZone: 'UTC' to stabilize display; retain unless changing comprehensively with tests.

The “Inspiration Award” qualification piggybacks on isPastPresident—keep as-is unless owner requests change.

19) Operational Notes

Email sender is the Firebase extension account (tmprofessionallyspeakingatgmail.com as configured). Keep templates respectful and short.

Tooltips should guide first-time admins (add member, set availability, generate schedule).

When too many available members, unassigned but available names appear in the Availability panel so Toastmaster can hand-pick.

20) Roadmap Tags (not commitments)

Mentorship area (directory, preferences, booking, email notices).

Club SOP ingestion for schedule guidance.

Calendar sync (optional, opt-in).
