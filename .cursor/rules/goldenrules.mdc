Always reference the file `TM App Golden Rules.md` in this repository as the single source of truth.  
Follow its database schema, app logic, permissions model, and role assignment rules.  
Never rename collections, fields, or roles unless the spec explicitly allows it.  
Do not introduce a new database â€” all data must stay in Firebase Firestore.
