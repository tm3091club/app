Terms and Services

Effective date: October 6, 2025

Welcome to Toastmasters Monthly Scheduler (“TMS,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). These Terms and Services (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the website located at tmapp.club and any related applications, tools, and services (collectively, the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Service. TMS is a scheduling and coordination tool designed for Toastmasters clubs to plan meetings and assign roles. TMS is not affiliated with or endorsed by Toastmasters International, and any references to Toastmasters roles are descriptive only.

1) Who we are and what we do

TMS provides technology that enables clubs to plan and publish monthly meeting schedules, assign and manage meeting roles, track member availability and confirmations, generate shareable view-only links to schedules, and send optional operational reminders and notifications relating to meetings and roles. TMS also provides functionality for clubs to create and manage mentorship relationships, including pairing of mentors and mentees, the setting of goals or checkpoints, the recording of notes, and the viewing of basic progress over time. These mentorship features are tools for club coordination and are not an official Toastmasters International program; clubs remain solely responsible for determining mentorship criteria, participation, and outcomes. Share links are generated by users and are not controlled by an in-app enable/disable toggle; anyone who obtains a share link may view the corresponding schedule, and the same link may be further shared beyond the control of TMS. To reduce unintended exposure, share links are deleted every thirty (30) days, and once a link is deleted it will no longer function, although independently saved or forwarded copies outside of the Service may persist.

2) Eligibility and accounts

You represent and warrant that you have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement in your jurisdiction and that you will provide accurate account information, maintain the security of your credentials, and accept responsibility for all activities occurring under your account. You agree to notify us promptly if you suspect any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security.

3) Club spaces, content, and shared access

Club spaces within the Service may contain member lists, availability information, schedules, notes, and similar materials (“Club Data”). Authorized club users control the creation, modification, and distribution of Club Data. You acknowledge that any schedule links generated through the Service are view-only, that anyone who has or obtains the link can access the schedule, and that you must treat such links as public and share them responsibly. TMS deletes generated schedule links every thirty (30) days; deleted links will cease to function, but TMS cannot control copies or forwards shared outside the Service.

4) Communications and notifications

By using the Service, you consent to the receipt of operational and transactional communications relating to meetings, roles, schedules, mentorship coordination, account administration, and security. Where feasible, the Service may include settings to manage non-essential communications, but you agree that certain administrative or security notices are intrinsic to the Service and may be sent regardless of your preferences, as permitted by applicable law.

5) Privacy

Our Privacy Policy explains our collection, use, disclosure, and protection of information in connection with the Service, including the use of third-party infrastructure for authentication, hosting, databases, and delivery of communications. The Privacy Policy is incorporated into and forms part of these Terms. You agree to review the Privacy Policy prior to using the Service and to comply with its terms.

6) Acceptable use

You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful, infringing, deceptive, harassing, harmful, or abusive activity, not to introduce malware or other malicious code, not to interfere with or disrupt the Service or its security features, not to attempt to gain unauthorized access to accounts, systems, or data, not to scrape, harvest, or extract data except as permitted by the Service’s intended functionality, and not to reverse-engineer any part of the Service except to the limited extent such restriction is prohibited by applicable law. TMS may remove content, restrict features, and suspend or terminate access where it believes, in good faith, that these Terms or applicable law are being or may be violated.

7) Your content

As between you and TMS, you retain any rights you hold in Club Data and other material you upload, submit, or otherwise make available through the Service (“Your Content”). You grant TMS a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, process, transmit, display, and otherwise use Your Content for the purpose of operating, improving, securing, and providing the Service and as you instruct through Service features, including the generation and delivery of view-only links. TMS may remove or disable access to any content that TMS reasonably believes violates these Terms or applicable law.

8) TMS materials and intellectual property

The Service, including software, design, interfaces, compilation, and marks, is owned by TMS or its licensors and is protected by intellectual property and other laws. Except as expressly permitted by these Terms or by applicable law, you may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, lease, sublicense, or reverse-engineer any part of the Service. Third-party names, logos, and marks referenced in the Service are the property of their respective owners and are used for identification only.

9) Service changes and availability

TMS may, in its discretion, improve, modify, or discontinue any portion or feature of the Service at any time. The Service may be unavailable due to maintenance, outages, or events beyond our reasonable control. TMS may update these Terms from time to time; material changes will be indicated by an updated effective date and reasonable notice. Your continued use of the Service following any change to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.

10) Fees

TMS provides a free plan that permits access limited to one (1) month of scheduling for the purpose of testing the scheduler and the weekly agenda. The paid plan costs five United States dollars (US $5) per month per subscribing club or workspace and unlocks full access to the Service, including the mentorship section and continued access beyond one month. Fees are charged in advance, are non-refundable, and, unless otherwise stated, exclude applicable taxes, carrier charges, and currency conversion fees, which you are responsible for paying. Subscriptions renew automatically each month until you cancel; cancellation prevents future renewals and you will retain access through the end of the current paid period. Your payments support the operation of the Service, future updates, bug fixes, and access to assistance from a support team member. TMS may change prices prospectively upon reasonable notice for future billing cycles.

11) Third-party services

The Service may integrate with or rely on third-party services and infrastructure, including without limitation authentication, hosting, databases, email or push-notification delivery, and analytics. Your use of third-party services may be governed by terms and policies of those providers. TMS is not responsible for third-party websites, services, or content that it does not control.

12) Warranties and disclaimers

The Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, TMS disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, or statutory, including any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and quiet enjoyment. TMS does not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free of harmful components, or that defects will be corrected.

13) Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, TMS and its directors, officers, employees, agents, and suppliers will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or business opportunities, arising out of or relating to your use of or inability to use the Service, even if TMS has been advised of the possibility of such damages. To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, the aggregate liability of TMS for all claims arising from or related to the Service will not exceed the greater of one hundred United States dollars (US $100) or the total amount you paid to TMS for the Service in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations or exclusions of liability; in such jurisdictions, the foregoing limitations and exclusions apply only to the extent permitted by law.

14) Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless TMS and its directors, officers, employees, agents, and suppliers from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable legal fees, arising out of or in any way connected with Your Content, your use of the Service, or your violation of these Terms or applicable law.

15) Termination

You may stop using the Service at any time. TMS may suspend or terminate your access to the Service, in whole or in part, with or without notice, if TMS reasonably believes that you have violated these Terms or applicable law, if your account is inactive for an extended period, or if TMS elects to discontinue the Service. Where reasonably feasible and lawful, TMS will provide notice and, if applicable, reasonable instructions to export Your Content prior to shutdown.

16) Dispute resolution; governing law; venue (global)

Before initiating formal proceedings, you and TMS agree to attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute informally by contacting the other party using the contact details available through the Service and allowing a reasonable time to respond. To respect our worldwide user base, the laws governing these Terms and any dispute arising out of or relating to them will be the laws of the country, state, or province that you indicate as your primary residence at the time you create your TMS account, without regard to its conflict-of-laws rules. To the extent that the mandatory consumer-protection or other non-waivable laws of your location confer additional rights or require a different result, those mandatory provisions will apply. Unless a different forum is required by such mandatory laws, you and TMS agree that any disputes will be brought exclusively in the competent courts located in the city or region nearest to your primary residence at signup, and the parties may agree to arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution permitted under local law in that same location. Nothing in this section prevents a party from seeking urgent injunctive or equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.

17) Changes to these Terms

TMS may revise these Terms at any time. Material revisions will be identified by an updated effective date and reasonable notice through the Service or by email. Your continued use of the Service after the revised Terms become effective constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.

18) Miscellaneous

These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and TMS concerning the Service and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements on the subject matter. If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. TMS may assign or transfer these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or by operation of law. The headings in these Terms are for convenience only and do not affect interpretation. You agree to
